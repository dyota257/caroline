    <h1>Mahjong Match-up</h1>
    <h2>Make a new friend!</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>You have a mahjong tile. Don't lose it! Find someone else who has another mahjong tile that has something in common with yours. It could be the suit, or number, or colour, or character.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>With your new friend, find something that the two of you have in common with each other.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Swap tiles with your friend and go back to Step 1!</p>
